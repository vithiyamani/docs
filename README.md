# Why samantha?

Why Samantha? To help simplify your life, stay organized, and feel supported. Samantha was created with that purpose in mind, inspired by the concept of an AI that understands your priorities, helps you focus, and gets things done with minimal friction—like the AI in _Her_ (2013), but reimagined for real-world practicality.

### In Her

In _Her_, Samantha seamlessly integrates into Theodore’s life by intuitively understanding his needs. She helps him manage his work, organize his tasks, and even explore creative ideas in ways he couldn’t have alone. Similarly, our Samantha is designed to do more than assist; she adapts to you, guiding your workflow, decluttering your mind, and helping you operate at your best.
